Welcome to Evendate Docs!
===================

Before you start 
-------------

#### <i class="icon-file"></i> Just read it

I think you want to work with Evendate API documentations, right? For example, you want to make some requests and may be find errors. So, before you start. Open your hosts file and add one new line: 

`5.101.124.61 test.evendate.org`

Added? Good boy. Now try to open `test.evendate.org` and authorize with any oAuth provider. 

#### <i class="icon-folder-open"></i> Making requests

I see you are in hurry. Not so fast. We have to read documentation before making requests.

#### <i class="icon-pencil"></i> Read this article. I said READ. JUST FUCKING READ IT.
 
[Very big and good article][1]

#### <i class="icon-trash"></i> That's all
